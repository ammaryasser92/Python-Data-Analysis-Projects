    "at first glance, it seems like the \"pupper\" dog stage is the most favored dog since it has the hightest favorite count. but further investigation reveals that this is probably due to the existence of outliers. and this is confirmed when the stage is plotted against the mean favorite count rather than the raw favorite count. further inspection also shows that \"puppo\" dogs are the most favored dogs as they had the highest mean favorite count. \n",
